<description>"BCDs" also known as the Battlefield Casualty Drills are a series of emergency medical procedures for the basic soldier.

First Aid are a series of drills executed with a sense of urgency.

This mod allows players to tend to downed pawns on the spot in quicker time than normal tending at the expense of quality in order to prevent further blood loss and to get friendlies back in the fight and perform CASEVAC as soon as possible.
