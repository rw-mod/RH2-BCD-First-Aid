<description>Save precious time during the golden hour of survival with this first aid mod!

"BCDs" also known as the Battlefield Casualty Drills are a series of emergency medical procedures for the basic soldier.

First aid allows your pawns to tend to downed casualties on the spot. If medical resources or a hospital bed is available nearby, the medic will utilize these before hastily performing first aid.

The following mod adds:
- New right click option on downed pawns to "Perform first aid"
- First aid tends to downed pawns without a bed
- First aid will allow the medic to grab the nearest medicine resource, otherwise they will tend to the casualty with no medicine
- Can be used on enemy pawns and friendlies
- First aid tending speed is faster than normal tending, however the quality of tending is reduced

What is BCD?
